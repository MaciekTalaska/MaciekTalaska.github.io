All the questions that has been put into the hackpad:
    Is it a good time to make a jump from Ruby to Elixir?

    What could be the negative consequences of switching from Ruby to Elixir? ;)

    When refactoring existing RoR app to Elixir, which part of the app would you recommend to start with?

    What would be the good and bad use case for using `mnesia`?

    What projects is Elixir good for?

    Are there any performance hiccups/overheads related to (erlang's) garbage collector (e.g. how does elixir GC compare to `stop the world` problem in java)?

    Are there any good libraries for interacting with relational databases? (if so - which would you suggest?)

    Why Elixir is “sold” to us as “new better Ruby” while its underlying principles are totally different? Won’t it result in Elixir programmers that do not understand Elixir (like Rails programmers that do not know Ruby)?

    Are there any hardware-interaction Elixir libs or patterns that would potentially open a path for Elixir to IoT world - wouldn't rails be better for a deployment on a smart watch?:)

    Is there a huge difference between tools available for Elixir and Ruby (IDEs, plugins, etc.)?

    Should new comers start with Elixir or Ruby? As most of the talk today that happens is about scaleable, high throughput web apps. Is scaling relevant to everyone?

    What applications or common problems are not good fit for Elixir? So if we have multiple micro-services should be kept in Ruby?

    Is Phoenix going into Rails direction and will it suck in like 5 years?

    What are the bad parts of Erlang / Elixir?

    How many of your past projects would fit more to use elixir instead of ruby?

    If I would want to create a chat app, why would I want to use Elixir instead of Node?
