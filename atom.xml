    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I was thinkig for quite some time to migrate my old blog from Wordpress to some other blogging platform. There are couple of reasons to think about such a change:</p>
<ul>
<li>I don’t think I really need the flexibility that Wordpress offers. I think for me it is just too much. I am not planning to write blog with someone else (so I don’t need platform which supports many authors)</li>
<li>Wordpress is being of interest of many people who find it funny to deface someone’s site. I don’t think I want to spend that much time making sure my installation is up to date and is not vulnerable to attacs. That all takes time.</li>
<li>Wordpress requires hosting. And that costs.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some time ago I’ve bumped on couple of people saying that static sites generators are great for blogging purposes. It seemed to me a good idea having my blog hosted on github, so that I can have all the things in one place.</p>
<p>I’ve heard about Jekyll, Nikola, Pelican but I knew there were many more. I had to figure out what my needs are, and after a short while, I came up with the most important features my preferred blogging platform should offer:</p>
<ul>
<li>good support for code snippets (as I will be using this mainly for my programming related blogging)</li>
<li>support for plugins (for example: I want to be able to use disqus for comments)</li>
<li>offering some nice themes, so that I can pick something for the very beginning</li>
</ul>
<p>My workmate suggested me to have a look at Nikola. The installation was easy (I’ve used virtualenv so not to spoil my environment). It took me a bit to have a first blog post in the shape of my desire. Although… I wasn’t very happy with Nikola. Mainly because:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nikola is quite slow, re-generating your site takes quite some time</li>
<li>I’ve spent some time searching for nice themes, and… I was quite dissappointed. I wasn’t happy with what I’ve found.</li>
<li>my feeling is that there are not many plugins, and that the community behind Nikola is not very big</li>
</ul>
<p>After my experience with Nikola, I decided to give some others platforms a chance. I’ve made some research, and found a site that lists many static sites generators: <a href="https://www.staticgen.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">https://www.staticgen.com/</a> It is definitelly more than enough. I was amazed how many generators are there. Not only for Python and Ruby, but also for functional languages (Haskell, Scala) and some really exotic languages such as Racket (<a href="https://www.staticgen.com/frog" target="_blank" rel="external">https://www.staticgen.com/frog</a>).<br>One of my thoughts was that I should probably go with Jekyll as it has the biggest community, dozens of themes and plugins. What’s more, I think that in comparison to Nikola, it may be easier to find some articles on how to change things in Jekyll. I was pretty much set for trying Jekyll, when I spotted Hexo (<a href="https://www.staticgen.com/hexo" target="_blank" rel="external">https://www.staticgen.com/hexo</a>).</p>
<p>Hexo is written in JavaScript and uses NodeJS. It claims to be very fast. And comparing to Nikola… I must say that this is true. Hexo is even easier to set up than Nikola. If you already have NodeJS on your machine, there is just one package to install. After about a minute I had my “blog” created. Within next couple of minutes I had couple of sample notes, with codeblocks and gists - I decided it looked better than what I was able to create using Nikola. I’ve spent next hour (or two) playing with themes, and doing my own modifications of themes. I am pretty happy with what I have achieved so far. Not everything is done yet, but I guess I am good to go with what I have.</p>
<p>Hexo supports codeblocks…</p>
<p>this is how it highlights Python…</p>

<p>and this… is how displaying gist looks like:</p>
<script src="//gist.github.com/38c4ca8e73d9792f8eae.js"></script>
<p>Having all that, I have created my main github page and within minutes I had this published.</p>
<p>I haven’t thought that doing that will be so much fun. I regret I haven’t devoted some time to setup a new blog much earlier this year. Anyway, I hope to share with you some of what I learn. Stay tuned!</p>
