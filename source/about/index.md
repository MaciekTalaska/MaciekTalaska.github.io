## Who am I: 

My name is Maciej Talaśka. I am software software engineer/architect living and working in the beautiful city of Wrocław, Poland.

I have started my career back in 2003, starting with Microsoft technology stack (.Net).

Since then I had a chance to work on:
- desktop client applications (Windows Forms, WPF), 
- application servers
- client-server solutions 
- distributed systems
- tooling for the video game industry
- embedded systems for Digital Signage 
- banking systems for investment banks (3 out of the world's top 10)
- end-user applications for retails banks

My current intrests/fields of specialization are:
- modern front-end (AngularJS, ReactJS, AngularJS 2)
- JavaScript (ES5, ES2015)
- backend programming using NodeJS
- NoSQL (especially MongoDB, memcached)
- Python

I love to learn new things (especially programming languages).

I was working for startups, small and medium size companies as well as international corporations. 

I have worn many different hats: software engineer, tech lead/team lead and architect.


## Involvement in local communities

I am passionate about technology, and always eager to learn. That may sound like a cliche, but that's a fact
I am involved in the local technical communities in Wrocław:
- I am founder and organizer of "Rust Wrocław": http://rust-wroclaw.pl
- I am founder and organizer of "Wrocław functional programming" group: https://fp-wroc.github.io 
- I am founder and organizer of "Elixir Wrocław" group: http://elixir-wroclaw.github.io

I have organized several CodeRetreats (2012, 2013, 2014) in Wrocław, and a "Modern Web Workshop" (2014).

Some time ago, I have made a decision to leave .Net behind, and focus mainly on open source technologies. 

## Consultancy & freelancing

I am open for new opportunities and I am available for software consultancy - I am happy to help you with:
- architecture and overall design of IT Systems 
- introducing Agile methodologies (Scrum, Kanban)
- advising on technical stack
- development
