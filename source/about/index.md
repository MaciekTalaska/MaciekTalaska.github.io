## Who am I: 

My name is Maciej Talaśka. I am software developer/architect living and working in the beautiful city of Wrocław, Poland.

I have started my career over 10 years ago, starting with Microsoft technology stack (.Net).

Since then I had a chance to work on:
- desktop client applications (Windows Forms, WPF), 
- application servers
- client-server solutions 
- distributed systems
- embedded systems for Digital Signage 
- tooling for the video game industry

My current intrests/fields of specialization are:
- modern front-end (AngularJS, ReactJS, AngularJS 2)
- JavaScript (ES5, ES2015)
- backend programming using NodeJS
- NoSQL (especially MongoDB, memcached)
- Python

I am picking up Ruby on Rails at the moment (beginning of 2016) and I should have first "big" application deployed 2nd quater of 2016.

I was working for startups, small and medium size companies as well as international corporations. 

I have worn many different hats: developer, tech lead, team lead, architect.


## Involvement in local communities

I am passionate about technology, and always eager to learn. That may sound like a cliche, but that's a fact
I am involved in the local technical communities in Wrocław:
- I am organizer of Wrocław functional programmin group: http://www.meetup.com/Functional-Programming-Wroclaw/
- I am organizer of "AngularJS Wrocław" group: http://www.meetup.com/AngularJS-Wroc%C5%82aw/
- I am co-organizer of "GLUG Wrocław" (Go language group): http://www.meetup.com/GoLang-User-Group-Wroclaw/

I have organized several CodeRetreats (2012, 2013, 2014) in Wrocław, and a "Modern Web Workshop" (2014).

Some time ago, I have made a decision to leave .Net behind, and focus on open source technologies only. I am very happy with that choice of mine.

## Consultancy & freelancing

I am open for new opportunities and I am available for software consultancy - I am happy to help you with:
- architecture and overall design of a system
- introducing Agile methodologies (Scrum, Kanban)
- advising on technical stack
