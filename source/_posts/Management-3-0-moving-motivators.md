Couple of days ago I had a chance to attend first meeting of the newly created group focusing on "Management 3.0". My understanding was that it was planned to talk about the burn-out and motivation for work, but it turned out that this has been slightly changed.

After the introduction we started talking about our expectations regards the group and the meetings. It was great, as I had a very little knowledge of what the Management 3.0 is all about (and there were others who knew a lot more in this area than myself).

At some point we have started discussing work motivation factors, and Piotr - event host - introduced the concept of "moving motivators". As Piotr explained - there were some psychological studies and it seems that there are 12 main motivators: but as 2 of them refer to very personal area (family & sex relationship) we have focused on the remaining 10. Piotr has prepared a card pack for each attendee. The pack contained following cards:
- curosity (I have plenty of things to investigate and to think about)
- maestry (My work challenges my competence but it is still within my abilities)
-relatedness (I have a good social contact with the people in and around my work)
- status (My position is good, and recognized by the people who work with me)
- goal (My purpose in life is reflected in the work that I do)
- power (There's enough room for me to influence what happens around me)
- order (There are enough rules and policies for a stable environment)
- honor (I feel proud that my personal values are reflected in how I work)
- acceptance (The people around me approve of what I do and who I am)

We have briefly discusses the meaning of cards. What was surprising that many of us had different thoughs about the very same card(s).

Later Piotr asked us to put the cards in the following order:
- pick 3 which are the most important
- pick 4 that are also important, but not as important as the first 3
- pick 3 that are least important for us

It is all important in regards of picking new work. If 2 out of 3 "most important" things will actually be lower in new place - is this a good choice?

Another thing that Piotr mentioned was that it was important to take a photo of the order of the cards. Why? As our thinking of "what is the most important for me" changes through time. So it could be interesting to see how our approach to career/motivation goals change.
