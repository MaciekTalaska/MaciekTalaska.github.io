Last Saturday I had a chance to join couple of folks from Wroclaw and take part in the AngularJS+WebComponents workshop. The whole event has been run by the 10Clouds(http://10clouds.com) - interesting IT company from Warsaw which specializes in modern solutions (made mainly using JavaScript, Php and Python).

I have had a chance to work with AngularJS and that's why I was more interested in WebComponents part of the workshop. I have done some reading before the workshop on WebComponents, so I had a bit of understanding what these beasts are, but I have never created one myself :)
