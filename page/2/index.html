        <p>This week I have been preparing for starting work on my Linkr project. I have been thinking about functionalities, and what mechanisms the project should support. What I have planned so far is:</p>
<p>Milestone 1: </p>
<ul>
<li>any user should be allowed to add a link (URI) + short description of the resource</li>
<li>any user should be able to search (the search mechanism should look for the search term in the description and the URI itself)</li>
</ul>
<p>Milestone 2:</p>
<ul>
<li>user should be allowed to add tags</li>
<li>user should be allowed to sort filter links by tags </li>
</ul>
<p>Milestone 3:</p>
<ul>
<li>user should be allowed to create an acount - i.e. only registered users should be able to add new links (that whould be a change to what is M1)</li>
<li>only owner should be able to change description of the link (I think it should not be possible to remove added links)</li>
</ul>
<p>Milestone 4:</p>
<ul>
<li>user should be able to see only links of tags of interest (global filtering for logged in user)</li>
</ul>
<p>Mileston 5:</p>
<ul>
<li>‘likes’ - users should be able to sort links starting with those which were given the highest rank in the category. I am not sure how the sorting should actually work. I guess it should not sort all the links within particular tag - that would be a nonse, as it could happen that old link were displayed on the top all the time. Maybe it should be as follows: “sort by date first (descending) and then after the ranking”?</li>
</ul>
<p>Milestone 6:</p>
<ul>
<li>users should be allowed to use rss/atom - so that they’re constantly updated with new links being added</li>
</ul>
<p>Milestne 7:</p>
<ul>
<li>users should recieve email notification on new links - this option should be configurable, so that it is possible to receive a notifaction in following scenarios:<ul>
<li>no notifications at all</li>
<li>after there is a new link added</li>
<li>daily</li>
<li>on a specific day/time of the week (I am not really sure about that. I am not 100% sold to that idea, as I don’t know if such a flexibility is important. It may as well be fixed as - Friday 6PM GMT or something alike)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If I were to sum the whole idea of the project - I’d say that it is something like ‘delicious for a group of people’. I have a strong feeling that this could be useful for a group of people who may be exploring a specific area of knowledge, and this would be a nice thing to share their finding among the group.</p>

        <p>In my first blognote related to this years edition of “Get Noticed” I have mentioned that I am planning to develop web application using Elixir &amp; Phoenix. Why Elixr? </p>
<p>I have a chance to develop web applications using variety of technologies: C# + ASP.NET &amp; ASP.NET MVC, Python + Tornado, Ruby on Rails, JavaScript + NodeJS + Angular, Meteor (using Blaze as the frontend technolgy). Some technologies were more and some were less “developer friendly”. If I were to sum up what technolgies were the most fun to use I would say: RoR and JavaScript frameworks. MetorJS was a bit more fun, but NodeJS + Angular + MongoDB is something more solid, and still used even today (apart from the fact that teams are migrating from Angular 1.x). C# + ASP.NET/ASP.NET MVC were a bit less fun, altghough ASP.NET MVC was much better and I liked it a lot more than classic ASP.NET. What I didn’t particularly like about MS tech stack was that it was more of a blob than just language + technology stack. What I mean is that it is rather impossible to create something more complicated NOT using Visual Studio. Generators (as yeaoman, rake etc.) were not available at that time, so there was not a chance to use something else for working with code than Visual Studio. Everything was IDE driven. If there was a need to add additional fields to a database, or create new tables - all these actions were invoked from withing the IDE. It was so much different to the approach I could take develiping applications with pure JavaScript or Ruby. Having powerfull command line tools I felt I had more control over the process of application development. And I also had the feeling that I understood better what is happening and why.<br>So - the first thing would be “openess” or simply - technology being open source. Or even free - in terms of leaving all the decisions to the user.</p>
<h2 id="Scalability"><a href="#Scalability" class="headerlink" title="Scalability"></a>Scalability</h2><p>My personal opinion is that web applications are facing different problems that 10 years ago. Succesful applications right now often get extremely popular in a very short time. This means that it is important to design application with scalability in mind. And that is not so easy. The number of problems one has to face when it comes to designing scalable app is huge: beginning with responsiveness of the frontend itself, scalability of the workers, session management, and (probably the most complicated) picking up proper approach related to data storage. These are all non trivial problems. </p>
<p>Elixir is based on Erlang virtual machine. Erlang on the other hand is a language developed in 1986 by Swedish company Ericsson. Erlang was born alltogher with OTP - Open Telecom Platform - which was used to to control switches (as far as I understand at the beginning the aim was to control and connect phone calls). Erlang is being described as general purpose, concurrent, fault-tolerant &amp; functional programming language. The concurrency in Erlang is achieved by using actor model, which is extremely interesting concept. In short - Erlang is capable of spawning hundreds or even mant thousands of processes in a very short time. These processes are much lighter than OS processes, and are controlle by Erlang VM. Important thing is that Erlang comes with a lot of tooling for controlling processes. Elixir as a language based on Erlang benefits from all that.</p>
<p>As I see it nowadays - scalability becomes more and more important in the are of web applications development. Elixir seems like a perfect fit here. Why not Erlang itself? Well - partially because Elixir syntax seems more appealing to me.  </p>
<h2 id="Functional-Programming"><a href="#Functional-Programming" class="headerlink" title="Functional Programming"></a>Functional Programming</h2><p>I have a strong feeling that functional programming is one of the most important concepts that each and every developer should deeply grasp. I was taking some Scala and Haskell courses back in the past, but I lacked a proper “battlefield” to test my knowledge. I want to make an effort this year and develop my skills in the area of functional programming. What better opportunity than creating an application using functional programming language?</p>
<h2 id="Mature-technology"><a href="#Mature-technology" class="headerlink" title="Mature technology"></a>Mature technology</h2><p>I have already mentioned that the technology Elixir is based was created back in the 1986. It means that it is more than 30 years old. Quite a lot of time to prove its maturity.</p>
<h2 id="Friendly-community"><a href="#Friendly-community" class="headerlink" title="Friendly community"></a>Friendly community</h2><p>What is unique in Ruby community is its openness and friendliness. I had zero problems solving problems I bumped on, when developing my RoR applications. A lot of resources are available, and people in general are very happy to help someone who is not familiar with the technology.<br>I have the feeling that the same is true about Elixir community. Maybe it is due to the fact that a lot of people who are interested in Elixir have Ruby background, but I am not sure if this is the (only) case. </p>
<h2 id="Hype"><a href="#Hype" class="headerlink" title="Hype"></a>Hype</h2><p>Hype may not be the best word… I have a strong feeling that there is a lot of interest in Elixir. Not only from the developers but also from companies. More and more companies are evaluating Elixir and check if it is a good fit for their needs. I see a constant rise in interest of hiring people who are familiar with Elixir. And this interest is no longer only from the companies located on the West Coast of US - there are more and more companies using Elixir located in Europe. I treat the whole adventure as an investment for the future.</p>

        <p>Some as last year - this year another edition of “Get Noticed” initive is being started. The whole idea is quite simple - to blog about a project - software that will be developed during the next couple of months (all starts beginning of March 2017, ends in May). </p>
<p>Last year I tried to take part in it, but due to some unpredicted things happening - I was not able to devote enough time for it, and didn’t manage to finish the application. I hope this year is going to be different and that I will be able to share quite a lot of thoughts &amp; decisions related to application development.</p>
<p>My idea for the application is still the same - I want to create a simple web application that will allow people to share links to interesting resources. That’s it. Simple stuff. I hope that as time goes by I will implement more and more features for that.</p>
<p>So… as the idea for the application itself stays the same as last year - you may want to read a post about it from last year: <a href="/2016/03/17/Let-them-know-you/">Let them know you</a> </p>
<p>One thing is changing this year though - I have picked different language (or should I actually say - technology stack?). Last year my choice was to use Ruby+Rails. I was a total newbie with Rails&amp;Ruby at that time, and apart from going through some tutorials I haven’t created any application on my own using RoR. </p>
<p>So what’s my techonlogy of choice this year? Wel… this year it is going to be Elixir+Phoenix. I haven’t made any other decisions yet. I am not sure what storage I am going to use. I am not sure if I am going to use ReactJS, AngularJS, VueJS or any other fancy technology for the frontend itself, or if I leave it as a pure Phoenix frontend. I hope to make all that decisions while developing the application, and will try to document my choices here - on my blog.</p>

        <p>Interesting idea has spread in Poland among software developers recently - it is called “Let them know you” (“Daj się poznać” in Polish). It is all about developing an open-source project, and blogging about it for ~3 months (roughly twice a week).</p>
<p>I thought that as I don not have a lot of time - it is the best idea to join it!</p>
<p>Couple of years ago, I was working for a company which had a very cool thing happening - it was called “Something new, something interesting, something cool”. It was a weekly digest emails containing links to articles, blog notes etc. which were found interesting/worth sharing by some developers. These links were then put into an email by one person, and sent to all interested within the company.</p>
<p>I was so bought by this idea that I have even started doing this on my own in one of the companies I was working next. At some point I have realized that doing it all manually was the biggest disadvantage of the whole idea. I happened to forgot about including some links. I have also forgtten couple of times to send the email…</p>
<p>There were also other problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>there was no easy way to search through all the links that have been sent</li>
<li>newcomers were usually not aware of this initiative at all - someone had to tell them about it</li>
<li>when a new person wanted this email digest to be send to them - I had to update the distribution list… again a 100% manual process</li>
</ul>
<p>Taking all these things under consideration - myself and my friend Cyryl(github: <a href="https://github.com/cyplo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://github.com/cyplo</a> blog: <a href="https://blog.cyplo.net" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://blog.cyplo.net</a>) started thinking about starting a project that would solve some of those problems. In the end of 2014 we have created a scaffolding of the Ruby on Rails project, but… after the initial couple of commits we have ‘forgotten’ about it, and for about a year we haven’t contributed to it at all. Recently I have decided to resurect the project, and push it forward. And the “Let them know you” initiative seems to be the perfect opportunity to be more devoted in working on the project.</p>
<p>The github repository is located under the following location: <a href="https://github.com/curalink/curalink" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://github.com/curalink/curalink</a></p>

        <p>Last Saturday I have attended AngularJS 2.0 workshop organized in Wrocław. The event has been organized by DevMeetings (<a href="http://devmeetings.pl)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://devmeetings.pl)</a>, started ~9 am and finished rougly 6 hours later.</p>
<p>Hosts were employees of LiveChat (<a href="https://www.livechatinc.com/)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.livechatinc.com/)</a>. One of them - Wojciech Kwiatek - gave a talk on AngularJS2 based on their experience at one of the local tech groups. LiveChat decided to switch to AngularJS2 couple of months ago - even though AngularJS2 was not stable at all at that time (they have jumped on the AngularJS2 bandwagon when the whole thing was still in alpha!). It seems they are still pretty happy with the decision. I know that they have been looking at ReactJS as well, but decided that ReactJS may not fit that well into their usecase, and they would need to create a framework from many libraries on their own - so the ‘completeness’ of AngularJS2 was also important.<br>It was great that hosts had real experience with AngularJS2, and not only “played with it” at home :)</p>
<p>Two skeletons of the apps were prepared - one using gulp, and the other utilizing webpack. If you would like to have a look, the webpack version is freely available on github: <a href="https://github.com/wkwiatek/angular2-webpack2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://github.com/wkwiatek/angular2-webpack2</a></p>
<p>The whole agenda was as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Introduction to AngularJS2</li>
<li>Components</li>
<li>Events</li>
<li>Pipes</li>
<li>Services and Dependency Injection</li>
<li>Forms</li>
<li>Http+Rx.js</li>
<li>Routing</li>
</ol>
<p>It was quite a lot of stuff (mostly brand new to most of the attendees) and I don’t think a single person has managed to finish all the tasks. I have personally go through the first 6 of them, but haven’t touched Http+Rx.js &amp; routing at all.</p>
<p>I especially liked how forms are implemented in AngularJS2 - that is a common thing for web developers to create, and it is not of minor importance. We had interesting discussion on forms in ReactJS at one of the last local tech group meetings. Yes… forms are things you just can’t escape from :)</p>
<p>What I lacked a bit was how to structure the whole application. I have spotted that many attendess just took the “finished? go with the next task” approach, and had most of the code in single .ts file. I just wanted to avoid that, and spend some more time on re-structuring the application, so I had everything (classes, components) in separate files.</p>
<p>Summary:<br>I am happy I have attended the event. I only read about AngularJS2 before, and apart from tiny snippets, I have not written any AngularJS2 code. This was the best opportunity to get more familiar with the technology, create something bigger, and get the ‘feeling’ of the new, upcoming and technology.</p>
<p>The event was another opportunity to do some more coding in TypeScript. I am not sure if I like it or not… on one hand it seems to mee just too much of a ‘C# for JavaScript developers’ type of approach, I realize that there is additional effort required to have type definition for all the libraries you use. But on the other hand - I think that TypeScript may allow for further improvements of JavaScript performance (thanks to type annotations and optimizations that could be possible to achieve thanks to it).</p>
<p>Thanks to Wojciech Kwiatek, his friend from LiveChat (sorry, forget the name) and DevMeetings team for making this event happen!</p>
